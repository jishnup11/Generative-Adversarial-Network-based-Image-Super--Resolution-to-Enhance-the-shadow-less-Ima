# Generative-Adversarial-Network-based-Image-Super--Resolution-- model
In this work, an Enhanced shadow-removal method were introduced and the pipeline consists of the shadow-removal module and the image super-resolution module.  
# Major technical contributions in this work are as follows:
1. GAN based image super-resolution module with custom loss functions and
generator, discriminator architecture which gives promising results compared to
the standard algorithms.

2. Enhanced Shadow-Removal pipeline to remove shadow, which always
guaranties high quality output image for the given input image. 

3. Introduction of the combined loss which improved the overall performance of
the GAN and helped to generate higher quality images as well as extensive
shadow-removal
